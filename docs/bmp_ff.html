<center><br><h1>The .bmp file format</h1></center><br>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
The .bmp file format (sometimes also saved as .dib) is the standard for a Windows 3.0 or later <a href="bmsinwin.html">DIB(device independent
bitmap)</a> file. It may use compression (though I never came across a compressed .bmp-file) and is (by itself) not capable of storing
animation. However, you can animate a bitmap using different methods but you have to write the code which performs the animation. 
There are different ways to compress a .bmp-file, but I won't explain them here because they are so rarely used. The image data itself can
either contain pointers to entries in a color table or literal RGB values (this is explained later).<p><br>

<h3>Basic structure:</h3>
A .bmp file contains of the following data structures:
<pre>
BITMAPFILEHEADER    bmfh;
BITMAPINFOHEADER    bmih;
RGBQUAD             aColors[];
BYTE                aBitmapBits[];
</pre>
<i>bmfh</i> contains some information about the bitmap file (about the file, not about the bitmap itself). <i>bmih</i> contains information
about the bitmap such as size, colors,... The <i>aColors array</i> contains a color table. The rest is the image data,
which format is specified by the <i>bmih</i> structure.<p><br>

<h3>Exact structure:</h3>
The following tables give exact information about the data structures and also contain the settings for a bitmap with the
following dimensions: size 100x100, 256 colors, no compression. The <i>start</i>-value is the position of the byte in the file at
which the explained data element of the structure starts, the <i>size</i>-value contains the nuber of bytes used by this
data element, the <i>name</i>-value is the name assigned to this data element by the Microsoft API documentation.
<i>Stdvalue</i> stands for standard value. There actually is no such a thing as a
standard value but this is the value Paint assigns to the data element if using the bitmap dimensions specified above (100x100x256).
The <i>meaning</i>-column gives a short explanation of the purpose of this data element.<p>

<h3>The BITMAPFILEHEADER:</h3>

<a name="bmih"><h3>The BITMAPINFOHEADER:</h3>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
		<td>start</td>

		<td>name</td>
		<td>stdvalue</td>
		<td>purpose</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>15</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biSize</td>

		<td>specifies the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure, in bytes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>specifies the width of the image, in pixels.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>23</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biHeight</td>
		<td>100</td>
		<td>specifies the height of the image, in pixels.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>2</td>
		<td>biPlanes</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>35</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biSizeImage</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>specifies the size of the image data, in bytes. If there is no compression, it is valid to set this member to zero.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>39</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biXPelsPerMeter</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>specifies the the horizontal pixels per meter on the designated targer device, usually set to zero.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>43</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biYPelsPerMeter</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>specifies the the vertical pixels per meter on the designated targer device, usually set to zero.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>47</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biClrUsed</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>specifies the number of colors used in the bitmap, if set to zero the number of colors is calculated using the biBitCount member.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>51</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>biClrImportant</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>specifies the number of color that are 'important' for the bitmap, if set to zero, all colors are important.</td>
	</tr>
</table><br>
Note that <i>biBitCount</i> actually specifies the color resolution of the bitmap. The possible values are: 1 (black/white);
4 (16 colors); 8 (256 colors); 24 (16.7 million colors). The biBitCount data element also decides if there is a
color table in the file and how it looks like. In 1-bit mode the color table has to contain 2 entries (usually white and
black). If a bit in the image data is clear, it points to the first palette entry. If the bit is set, it points to the second.
In 4-bit mode the color table must contain 16 colors. Every byte in the image data represents two pixels. The byte is
split into the higher 4 bits and the lower 4 bits and each value of them points to a palette entry. There are also
standard colors for 16 colors mode (16 out of Windows 20 <a href="rescolrs.html">reserved colors</a> (without the
entries 8, 9, 246, 247)). Note that you do not need to use this standard colors if the bitmap is to be displayed on a
screen which support 256 colors or more, however (nearly) every 4-bit image uses this standard colors. In 8-bit mode
every byte represents a pixel. The value points to an entry in the color table which contains 256 entries (for details see
<a href="palinwin.html">Palettes in Windows</a>. In 24-bit mode three bytes represent one
pixel. The first byte represents the red part, the second the green and the third the blue part. There is no need for a
palette because every pixel contains a literal RGB-value, so the palette is omitted.<p>

<h3>The RGBQUAD array:</h3>
The following table shows a single RGBQUAD structure:<br>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
		<td>start</td>
		<td>size</td>
		<td>name</td>
		<td>stdvalue</td>
		<td>purpose</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rgbBlue</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>specifies the blue part of the color.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rgbGreen</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>specifies the green part of the color.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rgbRed</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>specifies the red part of the color.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>rgbReserved</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>must always be set to zero.</td>
	</tr>
</table><br>
Note that the term <i>palette</i> does not refer to a RGBQUAD array, which is called <i>color table</i> instead.  Also
note that, in a color table (RGBQUAD), the specification for a color starts with the blue byte. In a palette a color always starts with
the red byte. There is no simple way to map the whole color table into a LOGPALETTE structure, which you will need to display
the bitmap. You will have to write a function that copies byte after byte.<p>

<h3>The pixel data:</h3>
It depens on the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure how the pixel data is to be interpreted
(<a href="bmpffrmt.html#bmih">see above</a>).<br>
It is important to know that the rows of a DIB are stored upside down. That means that the uppest row which appears
on the screen actually is the lowest row stored in the bitmap, a short example:<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
 		<th width="50%"><img src="../resources/nhouse.gif"></th>
		<th width="50%"><img src="../resources/mhouse.gif" < th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>pixels displayed on the screen</th>
		<th>pixels stored in .bmp-file</th>
	</tr>
</table><p>
You do not need to turn around the rows manually. The API functions which also display the bitmap will do that for you
automatically.<br>
Another important thing is that the number of bytes in one row must always be adjusted to fit into the border of a
multiple of four. You simply append zero bytes until the number of bytes in a row reaches a multiple of four, an example:<p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td align="RIGHT"><tt>6 bytes that represent a row in the bitmap:</tt></td>
		<td><tt>A0 37 F2 8B 31 C4</tt></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="RIGHT"><tt>must be saved as:</tt></td>
		<td><tt>A0 37 F2 8B 31 C4 <b>00 00</b></tt></td>
	</tr>
</table><p>
to reach the multiple of four which is the next higher after six (eight). If you keep these few rules in mind while working
with .bmp&nbsp;files it should be easy for you, to master it.<p>
